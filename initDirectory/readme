Update: 10/30
By: Jennifer Finaldi
Files: rootDirInit.c, dirEntry.h, dirEntry.c

Description: 
    - Change filename to initDirectory
    - Modify dirEntry.h struct to accommodate strings for location of self and root (. and ..)
    - Deleted dirEntry folder with old versions of header and implementation files

Notes:
    - initDirectory takes a parentLBA as a parameter, the first passed will be zero
    - initDirectory returns the start location of new directory in LBA
    - startingBlock currently hard coded to 50
    - locationSelf tracks which LBA block the current directory entry exists in. May also want
      to add a locationFile member to track which LBA block the file contents begin at, as well
      as the offset. 
    - strings for name and root needed to be 200 char limit in order to avoid entries exceeding
      512 bytes.
    - commented out other unnecessary fields in dirEntry struct to save space
    - initDirectory has not been tested yet with fsshell and hexdump
    - LBAWrite comment not tested either, since all code exists in its own file

To test this out:
    - cd initDirectory
    - gcc initDirectory.c dirEntry.cd
    - ./a.out
